Reading your chagrined e-mail, I thought of a quote by a German novelist (Juli Zeh) who, in one of her books, had a protagonist say: Der Sinn des Lebens ist das, was Ã¼brig bleibt, wenn man alles Sinnlose weglÃ¤sst. (in english: The meaning of life is what remains after leaving out everything meaningless).\n\nI like that quote a lot. There is no secret additive to create meaning. But there are a lot of things that definitely are not the meaning of life. Money? Gone when dead. Music? Not permanent. But the joy when playing music doesn't feel meaningless, therefore it's part of the meaning of life. Enjoying friendship, love, all these are not meaningless.\n\nIf you ask me, if that's all there is to life, that's not too shabby.\n\nThen again, I believe crises are real, and no good advice will open up shortcuts. I wish you well with all the e-mails you'll get, maybe it will bring you along, wherever you're headed. Enjoy the ride, take care,\n\nJan (33)\n\nGermany\n",

He had enjoyed the process of writing those songs, but once it was done, he was focused on the process of writing the next batch of songs.\n\nAgain, it's a lot easier said than done to get in touch with the process and the love of doing and divorce yourself from what happens afterwards.

Find a homeless shelter or soup kitchen or\n\nthe EFF or whatever piques your interest and you will feel like you're\n\nmaking a small difference, which could feel like a huge improvement.\n\nIt's a bit of a mental trick, right? You may feel better, but you also\n\nmay never make a dent in the universe (even though you'll surely be\n\nfondly remembered by many you helped).\n\n2) Write down the biggest problems in the world as you see it, figure\n\nout who is working on them, get in touch with them, don't settle for\n\nanything less than working on the most serious, world-changing project\n\nyou can possibly get involved with (it may only tangentially involve\n\nyour current career skill set). Go big, cast wide, expect rejection,\n\nbut genuine enthusiasm for a noble cause may get you further into a\n\ncommunity of world-class Doers than you think. And then you're one of\n\nthem.\n\nI think (1) is objectively pretty easy but many people don't get\n\naround to it, it gets lost in the daily grind of work and play. I\n\nthink (2) is outrageously difficult, but you should strongly consider\n\nit before you turn 40. Don't have this conversation with yourself\n\nagain in 10 years, if you value your happiness.\n\n(3) Make the next Snapchat, cash out, buy an island, volcano lair,\n\nrobot army.

It's funny because you wrote, that this outlook is  partly shaded by age, but I'm only 20 and still feel it in simliar way.\n\nWhen I was younger, I wanted to be a doctor, to help people not to die and make them feel better. But later, after few years of thinking about life and my decisions, I realized that even if I'd do my best and work 24 hours per day, I wouldn't change a thing. I found it very depressing, that even if I do anything in the world, it still will be tha same. But I realized, it's just the way it goes.\n\nI found my career path somewhere else, in the end, and later this year as I've prepared for my high school finals and worked in 3 different companies, I found myself lying on the floor, thinking that I should get up and work a bit, I always asked myself \"why?\" and none of my responses satisfied me. It just made another \"why\" pop up. But as for now(and hopefully for the future as well) I think, maybe even the small things can enrich the world - maybe your e-mail made someone think about life and made them change their life for better. Maybe it just put smile on their face, because they felt it same way. I call it enrichment.

As time goes on, the realities of our dreams can discourage action or mutate our expectations of what were to be.\n\nI've found a neat solution, in an ironic sense, which is working for myself - embrace the chaos and \"incorrectness\".\n\nYou say you're interested in making music, but that the impermanence of time and futility of perception discourages you. I'd make music that expresses that discontent acoustically! Make a song with no beat. Give it the finger! Throw it on to Soundcloud - that way people can listen to it, download it, have it inspire them. I've met many friends this way. Expression works.\n\nMercutio says it best: \"If love be rough with you, be rough with love. Prick love for pricking and you beat love down!\" \n\nThanks for the creative prompt. Hope this helps :)\n\nLet's keep in touch, and I hope to hear your songs sometime!",

I took a job managing a book business\n\n(in my 5th year now) because it pays well.  The work is fine.  \n\nSo where does that leave me?  In a career that I will probably stick with\n\nbecause it is pleasant enough and I am starting to live comfortably, but was\n\nnever my intended goal.

Though those around you may account for an insignificant number of the organisms on the planet but the vast majority of organisms are not concerned with you or your behaviors. The scale of impact may be greater with an asteroid than a display of altruism by a chimpanzee but both are natural and both are part of the evolutionary process.\n\nConsidering the billions of humans who have walked the earth the number whose actions have affected the direction of history is relatively minute. How many Alexander the Greats are there? How many Madame Curies are there? As it turns out, there are just as many of them as there are of you.

I've always wanted to make an impact on the world and be immortal in a sense (through writing or some incredible deed that somehow \"saves the world.\") As you can imagine, I have been obsessed with superheroes since I was a kid. And when I was much much younger, I thought, \"hey, one day, my superpowers will come in, and then I can go out and right the wrongs of the world and make it a better place.\" Fast forward 15-20 years - no superpowers still. (Unless you count making and feeding an entire human being with only the power of my body. But hey, every second person on the world can do that. It doesn't seem so super then.) Ok so my solution (or what I'm trying to do now to help me not be depressed about how insignificant and tiny lives seem in comparison to the grand scheme of things) - write novels and help people. \n\nWriting novels - haven't finished one yet, but I did start 4 or 5. I'm hoping that this November during NaNoWriMo, I will finish at least one. (NaNoWriMo - National Novel Writing Month) They may not be great novels, but maybe with practice, I can put something out there that someone will read and it will impact them and that person can go on to do bigger things that will impact more people. And the effect can snowball.\n\nHelping people - I became an attorney. Currently, I do things in the immigration arena, but I have done crim defense and family law - helping people change habits to keep their kids or helping people avoid going into a system that will derail their lives that were up-till-that-point full-of-ok-choices. Mostly I just want to do pro bono stuff in all areas. I can what a huge impact it has on people's lives to have their legal issues taken care of. It's a matter of keeping families together or helping some hard-working individuals have access to more opportunities or something along those lines. \n\nI don't think I'm in any position to give advice to anyone, but these things helped me, and hopefully it may help you as well!\n\nCheers,",

I also believe the human/energetic landscape we live in is much more fascinating complex than current science gives it credit for.\n\nAnyway, I know this sounds kind of like a cop out, but I would recommend taking a small amount of mushrooms in a very comfortable environment, listening to some music, and noticing the changes in your mental framework and how it makes you feel.  It has taught and shown me a lot and I rarely do it.\n\nAnyway, take care, and good luck and feel free to contact me anytime for any reason,",

And so... \n\nIs it maybe you have to order your priorities to reach happiness, so say buddhists. Something that you live with passion, searching more. \n\nSome people stop dreaming and become old, oders just keep dreaming. So, what is reality?

To largely impact someone else's world can be accomplished today.\n\nFind someone you can help, make it your top priority to effectively make a difference today in their life. Do that often as you can. Reap the benefits of friendship and slowly impact the world around you. Try to enjoy the roller-coaster of emotions that others will heave upon you as a result (both the good and bad ones). If you haven't found out yet, this life is all about relationships, not accomplishments.\n\nCheers!",

You have lived enough to see through some of the illusions you dreamed up as a teen and young adult.  \n\nIn my humble opinion, adulthood/growing up is simply getting to the point where you don't blame others for your actions.  Once you can do that, you can explore and try new things or just the next best thing until the next big thing comes along.  We live far longer than our predecessors did.  We have opportunities to have more than one career; to match our work with our passions if we are lucky.\n\nMusic, whether vocation or avocation, is a passion worth pursuing even if it doesn't meet the test of ages.  Music can touch a life and change it in an instant ... and in that instant, you have changed the world of someone forever.  That, to me, is a far greater gift than being remembered as a composer.  It is the hearts and lives you touch with music that creates magic.\n\nTouching, changing one person's live is an amazing gift because that one person will touch another's who will touch other's lives and the magic is passed along even if you end up in relative anonymity.\n\nAs for your education, it isn't what degree you have, it is what you do with it.  If you make your life better and those around you benefit then you have a made a lasting impression on the world.  Rejoice in that.  \n\nLove often and love well.\n\nGood luck.",

By measuring the worth of your life in terms of impact on enriching that of others, you're pretty much guaranteed to feel continuously challenged and happy. Is it ephemeral? I suppose, to the degree that our lives on earth are, but that lack of permanence has never dissuaded me from focusing on this perhaps narrow way of thinking about improving the world while I'm here. \n\nInvariably, through your own actions, your impact on others, and any children you leave behind, you will have lasting impact on the world, but why dwell on that which will come after you?\n\nGood luck!",
