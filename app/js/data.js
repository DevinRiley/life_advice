Reading your chagrined e-mail, I thought of a quote by a German novelist (Juli Zeh) who, in one of her books, had a protagonist say: Der Sinn des Lebens ist das, was Ã¼brig bleibt, wenn man alles Sinnlose weglÃ¤sst. (in english: The meaning of life is what remains after leaving out everything meaningless).\n\nI like that quote a lot. There is no secret additive to create meaning. But there are a lot of things that definitely are not the meaning of life. Money? Gone when dead. Music? Not permanent. But the joy when playing music doesn't feel meaningless, therefore it's part of the meaning of life. Enjoying friendship, love, all these are not meaningless.\n\nIf you ask me, if that's all there is to life, that's not too shabby.\n\nThen again, I believe crises are real, and no good advice will open up shortcuts. I wish you well with all the e-mails you'll get, maybe it will bring you along, wherever you're headed. Enjoy the ride, take care,\n\nJan (33)\n\nGermany\n",

He had enjoyed the process of writing those songs, but once it was done, he was focused on the process of writing the next batch of songs.\n\nAgain, it's a lot easier said than done to get in touch with the process and the love of doing and divorce yourself from what happens afterwards.

You may feel better, but you also\n\nmay never make a dent in the universe (even though you'll surely be\n\nfondly remembered by many you helped).\n\n2) Write down the biggest problems in the world as you see it, figure\n\nout who is working on them, get in touch with them, don't settle for\n\nanything less than working on the most serious, world-changing project\n\nyou can possibly get involved with (it may only tangentially involve\n\nyour current career skill set).

As time goes on, the realities of our dreams can discourage action or mutate our expectations of what were to be.\n\nI've found a neat solution, in an ironic sense, which is working for myself - embrace the chaos and \"incorrectness\".\n\nYou say you're interested in making music, but that the impermanence of time and futility of perception discourages you. I'd make music that expresses that discontent acoustically! Make a song with no beat. Give it the finger! Throw it on to Soundcloud - that way people can listen to it, download it, have it inspire them. I've met many friends this way. Expression works.\n\nMercutio says it best: \"If love be rough with you, be rough with love. Prick love for pricking and you beat love down!\" \n\nThanks for the creative prompt.

And when I was much much younger, I thought, \"hey, one day, my superpowers will come in, and then I can go out and right the wrongs of the world and make it a better place.\" Fast forward 15-20 years - no superpowers still. (Unless you count making and feeding an entire human being with only the power of my body. But hey, every second person on the world can do that. It doesn't seem so super then.) Ok so my solution (or what I'm trying to do now to help me not be depressed about how insignificant and tiny lives seem in comparison to the grand scheme of things) - write novels and help people. \n\nWriting novels - haven't finished one yet, but I did start 4 or 5. I'm hoping that this November during NaNoWriMo, I will finish at least one. (NaNoWriMo - National Novel Writing Month) They may not be great novels, but maybe with practice, I can put something out there that someone will read and it will impact them and that person can go on to do bigger things that will impact more people. And the effect can snowball.\n\nHelping people - I became an attorney. Currently, I do things in the immigration arena, but I have done crim defense and family law - helping people change habits to keep their kids or helping people avoid going into a system that will derail their lives that were up-till-that-point full-of-ok-choices. Mostly I just want to do pro bono stuff in all areas. I can what a huge impact it has on people's lives to have their legal issues taken care of. It's a matter of keeping families together or helping some hard-working individuals have access to more opportunities or something along those lines. \n\nI don't think I'm in any position to give advice to anyone, but these things helped me, and hopefully it may help you as well!\n\nCheers,",

You don't really have much to lose.\n\n \n\nWhen I was younger, I wanted to be a professional tennis player. Eventually, I realized it wasn't feasible as a steady career.\n\nThen in high school, I got good grades in economics. So people told me to pursue economics in university. And I did, because why not?\n\n \n\nTurns out I'm not a very good economist.\n\n \n\nEventually I settled on Business Marketing. Although this isn't the most useless major one could pursue in undergrad, I can hardly use it to change the world like a biochemist could use theirs.\n\n \n\nI know one thing I want to do with my life is start a NPO for young adults with disordered eating issues. I suffered from disordered eating (I can't actually say 'eating disorder' because the medical definition requires someone to be underweight -- and although I partook in starving and purging and plenty of other horrible habits, I never quite reached 'underweight'. I did try, though, and it almost killed me a half dozen times), so this issue is personal to me. This is a big challenge for someone of any age. But I still want to try because I know if someone had reached out to me sooner, they might've spared me several miserable years of self-hatred. I don't know that I'll change a life -- but I can always hope and I can definitely try. Right now I just reach out to young adults on an individual, word-of-mouth (or whatever the internet version of that is) basis. It doesn't always work, but sometimes it does help. I don't know how marketing is going to help me achieve it, but who knows? Maybe I'll use my skills to create awareness about the issue and hopefully save a few lives.\n\n \n\nI never would have expected that this is something I would've wanted to do with my life. I never thought I could change people's lives just by listening, emphasizing, and urging them towards the path to recovery. I feel extremely lucky that I've been recovered for a record length now -- almost 9 months. It doesn't seem like much, but I spent the entire previous year falling off the recovery wagon and  climbing back on. I don't change the world with what I do. And honestly, what I do won't matter in a few hundred millenia. But it's important to the person I'm reaching out to. It chanes their world. And that's all that matters to me.\n\n \n\nMaybe rethink what you want to actually change. Nobody is saying you have to give up your dreams. Just rethink how you can use your passions (or skills, or knowledge, whatever) to come at them from a different angle.\n\n \n\nGood luck!",

I am not sure what weight my little nugget of advice will have, but here it goes: try to go down to the roots of your passion for biology and music. What was it that made you so intrigued by these subjects and want to contribute to the field? When I think back on what turned me on to my career in public policy, I remember the teachers I had that truly ignited my interest in and passion for creating positive change. Now, not all of these teachers were social studies teachers who taught me about government and civics. These were teachers, many of whom decided to devote their lives to teaching a subject about which they were truly passionate, and make a change in their students' lives. One of my greatest teachers and role models was my high school physics teacher -- I had no interest in the subject, but he was determined to help me learn and understand the concepts in a way that which inspired me to work hard and try to make that kind of difference in another person's life.\n\nI suppose what I am trying to ask is this: have you considered a career in teaching? You could still pursue your interests while creating a legacy for future generations of students. You might ignite in them a passion for creating music, or an interest in biology. Your teaching style may excite them so that even though they might not be interested in your particular subject, they will be motivated to learn more and change the world. \n\nBest of luck in your future endeavors, whatever they may be!",

I have struggled with the exact same things that you are talking about at several points in my life. It is not a weird thing to struggle with. All that this means is that you have reached a level of consciousness where you begin to ask these questions. It is for the same reason that people who are so focused on getting by, and have no time to contemplate this things, never arrive at this level of consciousness.\n\nI have read a few books written by Tolstoy, and some books written about his life, only to find that he struggled with the same thing that you were talking about. He originally believed that life does not have meaning, and to live it as if it did would be illogical. Only once he reached a state of deep depression and contemplated suicide, did he discover that this is not the ultimate level of consciousness. He found that consciousness is cyclical. While he still contended that life was meaningless, our faith and our desire to persist is despite this \"meaninglessness\" is the actual meaning. By questioning what is life, what is the point, what makes me happy and why, you eventually arrive at the same point as people who never questioned it in the first place. Life is for living.\n\nOnce you stop scrambling around desperately seeking something to make you happy (which I have done on many occasions), you are able to take a deep breath and look around. Just enjoy it.\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't give you specific suggestions that you were looking for. But truth be told I just think that putting all of yourself into anything you do can make you happy. Work, a sport, a hobby. I have found that I enjoy my work 10 times more when I am working hard and taking pride in it.

No one will be around to remember you or your works.\n\nI see two paths toward solving your philosophical dilemma. The choice between them depends on your personality and inclinations. \n\nIf you consider yourself open to spiritual considerations, I would suggest reading the Bhagavad Gita. The protagonist of that story, a warrior approaching a pointless battle with an enemy that included his own kinsmen, felt an emptiness and sense of uselessness that is very similar to what you describe yourself as feeling.\n\nIf you are not religious and do not consider yourself particularly spiritual, I would suggest reading the existentialists, particularly Camus (\"The Myth of Sisyphus\" and other essays). He tackled the question of how to act in the absence of God, in a universe that seems to provide no meaning.\n\nMy own opinion arises from the observation that most historical solutions to the question of human purpose, whether grounded in religion or simply in ethics, revolve around how we treat other people. \"Be kinder\" is what most systems of meaning boil down to.\n\nBut what could be more ephemeral than kindness? What trace does it leave? Still, this is what the world's wisest recommend.\n\nI believe that, as creatures bound by time, our purpose is to act within the time we are given, without thought to legacy or posterity. Imagine you are on a sinking ship, with no hope of rescue. You cannot save yourself or others; only your own behavior until the end is under your control. \n\nDo you sit alone and contemplate your dilemma until the waves cover your head?\n\nOr do you comfort your fellow passengers (children, the terrified) as best you can, and go down hand in hand?\n\nWe are all in the same boat.\n\nGood luck to you!",

    "message": "\nHi {{ name }},\n\nI'm 65 and still learning about life. But I understand your problem. Perhaps you are expecting too much of longevity for your ideas. If you consider that you can influence, rather than merely leave some monument to your achievements, you may find greater satisfaction. \n\nI'll fill that out a bit. Few of us will attain the longevity of Shakespeare in what we leave behind. Even world-famous prophets like Buddha, Mohammed and Jesus have suffered from the distortion of their original thoughts and words. Probably the best we can do is influence those who come after us; influence them toward the ideas and philosophies we feel are important, good and productive. I'm a believer in justice, so I incorporate that theme into my writing. Some will get it (many will fail to see the message, of course) but those who do see it will absorb the idea and, probably subconsciously, incorporate it into their lives, words and deeds. It's the most we can hope for. \n\nThe simple, cliched but no less true ambition can really only be to leave this world a better place than you found it.\n\nEnjoy your life; it's the only one you'll have.\n\nRegards,",

    "message": "\nDear {{ name }},\n\nI absolutely know where you are coming from.\n\nI have felt similarly at times in my life. \n\nOf all the advice I could offer from my own experience, this is perhaps the essence of it:\n\nMeaning is found in the heart. Thoughts are like an endless circle, and in my experience will never lead to a deep sense of purpose. That deep sense comes from the heart.\n\nPerhaps begin to pay attention to your heart, and how it feels. How does it feel right now? Bring your attention there. What sensations, what emotions do you notice?\n\nThen begin to pay attention to how your heart feels at different times, and in response to various things. When something makes your heart sing, seek there. If your heart is singing always, you will be at peace in this world, and you will be in joy.\n\nHere is something else to try. You can do it right now. \n\nClose your eyes, and draw your attention inside. \n\nLocate that place or feeling inside you that feels that \"curious meaninglessness.\" There is wisdom here. \n\nGo deeper into that feeling. \n\nWhat do you find? \n\nWhat do you see in your mind's eye, what do you feel? Identify it. \n\nThen go deeper. \n\nGo deeper.\n\nFurther beneath, what do you feel, what do you find? Identify it. Feel it. Experience it.\n\nGo to the universal source within you. Let it express itself. Feel its nature.\n\nGo through all the layers until you find the source.\n\nIf you did this exercise, or have thoughts or questions or responses in general, I would be happy to hear from you.\n\nBless you,",

Even intensive sport, a good job and a wonderful wife did not satisfy this feeling. I felt anxiety and went through insomnia, etc. I took a year off to work in an NGO in Asia, it was fantastic but the question was still there.\n\nHaving kids changed my life, because with they force me to live in the present, and I now realize that the meaning of life is to enjoy any little moment in the present with them. I really think happines is about enjoying any little moment instead of consistently looking for a specific meaning. My kids taught me that, but I think learning to enjoy the present in any way (with or without a famly) will bring deep happiness. \n\nUnfortunately this world of iPhones and 3G pull us away from that (and I have myself a Blackberry, an iPhone, an iPod, an iPad, and 2 laptops). I enjoy my work as an engineer in a multi-national but I do not really care up to where I will go. I can die tomorrow, it would be sad, but I would say my life was great and worth it because I enjoyed all the moments of it, and I did my best to be nice. Especially with my kids. I know my goal in life now is to enjoy any minute, do my best to laugh a lot and not to be selfish.  \n\nThere are methods that can help: I read a lot about \"easy meditation\", or the type of books \"meditation for business people\", etc. It really helps. They teach you how to pause any time of the day and enjoy the \"NOW\". \n\nAnyway sorry for the very \"cliche\" words above; maybe you will receive 250 emails like mine. But it's how I feel. Good luck!",

    "message": "\n{{ name }},\n\nWhile I find your observation and position on life (and age) interesting, I also find them a bit naive and close minded.\n\nTime obliterates everything.\n\nTo say you won't create any kind of music that will last over a hundred years as a reason not to do it is ridiculous. Nothing created in this lifetime or any other should be made to sustain forever, or for even a long amount of time. Creation isn't for history, it's for you. Make your music because it brings you happiness or satisfaction, not because it will \"change the world\". Some of the greatest musicians/composers in all the world are barely \"hundreds\" of years old and millions of artists that are also amazing have already been \"forgotten\". With technology ever-changing, simply having a song in iTunes could potentially make it last \"forever\" anyways, and what does that mean... probably nothing. Suppose someone from years down the road hears your song, and has their world \"changed\", boom; you've changed the world. That could also happen tomorrow, or next year. But more importantly YOUR world would be changed because you created the song to begin with. \n\nI think you've latched on to the meaning of life being about what you do. In reality, it's about why you do them.\n\nAlexander the great had this same ideology about life, and eventually the history of the world won't have space for him in it either. Every year, old events are taken out of history books, and new ones are added in; this is exactly the way the history of the world works, everything is condensed until it is omitted.\n\nSo remember:\n\nChange one persons world and you have \"changed the world\". But more importantly, change your own.\n\nIn Time, everything is forgotten.",

    "message": "\n{{ name }},\n\nHoly shit, I'm pretty sure that I've had the exact same conversation with a friend of mine. We both came to the conclusion that no, we were not depressed, perhaps just disillusioned. We were sick of being \"passengers\" in our life. We are both young (24 and 27 years old), and felt that our contributions were simply doing nothing to make the world better, or really, just doing nothing at all. However, I feel that I'm doing something right by asking myself those two questions: \"how am I helping the world?\" and \"how am I going to be remembered?\"\n\nWell, it's hard when you're young and optimistic and you feel like you can expand your knowledge and influence ad infinitum. Hopefully, I've convinced you by now that I have and still sometimes feel this same way.\n\nSince I find generalized advice from people (especially on the Listserv) rarely actually means anything to how you live your day-to-day life, I'll just state the specific ways I've dealt with this feeling and hopefully it'll inspire your own solutions:\n\n    I quit my job where I felt like a cog in a very large machine. I now co-run my own business, helping small, local business grow (I'm sure you see this happen everyday, living in SF), which leads into my second action...\n\n    Started looking how I could have a local influence and help my fellow man in my own backyard: volunteering, teaching, whatever.\n\n    Stopped worrying on a cosmic (or even global) scale about my influence and mark on history: it only frustrated me and served to distract from my own goals.\n\n    I am religious, and no, I'm not trying to convert you; I'm just stating that It has helped me fill some of the gaps in that purposelessness.\n\nSome people say when you have children, that is the ultimate way to secure a legacy. I don't have kids yet so I can't speak to that. But, in the meantime, I'm just going to do my best to stop wasting energy worrying about these things and focus on the reality at hand.\n\nLastly, I read this article called, \"Just F*cking Do It\" the other day, and it really challenged me.

    "message": "\nHey {{ name }},\n\nI'll keep it short as I'm sure you'll get plenty of replies!\n\nEssentially, I'm 42 now and when I was 30/31 I went through the same things.  My passions were sport (mainly golf) and music.  They began to feel pointless (it turned out this was due to relationship issues).  I then went through a divorce from my wife, and also dropped the golf and music for a few years.  After my head settled down, I had so much desire to get back to what I loved doing (I found I did love golf and music after all), and I do them now because I like the feeling/feedback they give and the challenge and progression.\n\nI know it's all meaningless, but I do the things I do because I like it \"at the time\".\n\nAlso, my best friend and flatmate died when I was 34.  It was awful, and it made me realise you need to get stuck into life and maximise every day, so I became even more passionate about doing what I enjoy.\n\nTo sum up, your loss of purpose might be to do with other things not being right in your life.

    "message": "I've reached the ripe old age of 32, and I've had somewhat similar problems to yours, though from a different perspective. \n\nI mention my website first and foremost because it ties in to all of this. Do you remember Kindergarten? The earliest \"career day\" when you sat around and talked about what you wanted to be when you grew up? An astronaut, a fireman, the president, a mermaid... I have an uncle who served as my \"father figure\", as it were, and he was into computers when they were just starting to enter the home, so I'd been around some kind of technology for my entire life - five whole years as of that point. He was also kind of a kid at heart - we had all of the video game systems out at the time. (Boy, I wish I still had that collection!) I knew way back then that I wanted to make video games - it just seemed like the neatest thing ever.\n\nI've never really wavered from that, either. \n\nI spent the time I was growing up being told a handful of things that were probably intended to assist on the path - oh, you'll need to go to college for that, get a job as a tester and work your way up, you have to follow the most recent trends, etc. - but they all seemed to be missing something. This is akin to biology or music in a specific way - if you do look at my website, I did it. I am almost, after many years, at the point where my hobby pays its own expenses. I cannot honestly say I make any notable profit from it, and definitely not a living. I've got a grunt-labor job that almost covers the bills, and I make up the difference in odd-job design and video editing - but by golly, I made games. I'm still making games.\n\nI never wanted to \"get into the games industry\". My goal was not to \"get a job making games\". It sounds dumb, but stripped to its most basic, I wanted to make games. (I also wanted to play guitar. For my 21st birthday, I bought a guitar. I played with it until I figured out how to play to my own satisfaction.)\n\nI suppose my point is, it seems almost like a fear of your own mortality is creeping in and standing between you and the things you are genuinely passionate about. I know that it seems that there will be something keeping you from having any lasting impact in the world after you aren't here to continue to help it grow and learn. Here's an odd piece of trivia, though, that might help put things into perspective - I know it's helped me before, if nothing else by making me chuckle.\n\nWe're coming up steadily on the fiftieth anniversary of Woodstock. Summer of Love, all of that noise. The year that brought us seminal performances, memorable for a lifetime and beyond. A generation that, in many ways, reinvented rock and roll. Jimi Hendrix! The star-spangled banner on guitar, with feedback as an instrument! Pete Townsend singing out to a rising sun, \"Listening to You, I get the music...\"\n\nAll of this cultural redefinition. A generation rising almost in unison. And the Billboard number one selling single that year?\n\n\"Sugar Sugar\", by the Archies.\n\nNobody knows until it's far too late what's going to really matter - and it's very rarely what people expect at any time. Posthumous glory is never lauded on the living.\n\nIf you want to make music, make music. Make it for you. Make it for the people you love. Someone will hear it. Technology and progress and cultural shifts be damned - if you have something to share, share it. Someone will find and appreciate it. We're at a point now where very little is TRULY ephemeral - the world is an ever growing archive. Sing to yourself. Sing to me. But if you genuinely feel it, do it.\n\n(Forgive my mangling of grammar, but I'm twisting words to emphasize a point)\n\nIf you want to biology, then biology. Don't worry about \"being a biologist\". Learn. Grow. Share your knowledge. Tutor people - and find the most difficult ones you can, the ones who ask \"Why?\" until they drive you back to the books. Write down what you know. Write down what you think. Pass it along to everyone you know with any interest in the field. Hell, let me proofread papers you write just because you are passionate about sharing what you already know - even if other people already know it too. But don't let the \"real world\" interfere with doing something you are passionate about.\n\nIf you have lost sight of things, then do SOMETHING. Do ANYTHING. Find something that becomes a passion for you - regardless of its practicality, or purpose, or chance of lasting forever. Do something that becomes (in a positive way - I advise against heroin, for example) all-consuming. Something that you just cannot picture yourself not doing. Having access to that passion in your life can become a reason to exist unto itself. Don't deny it just because it doesn't feel permanent right now.\n\nFeeling like an observer in your own life is (in my opinion) not ENTIRELY removed from the truth. You have a choice, though - you can be \"merely\" an observer, or you can be a participant. You can't always be the sole driver, but you don't have to be just a passenger. There's no guarantee that what you do will change the world forever, but there's also no guarantee that it won't, just a fear.\n\nSilly Putty was invented by accident, after all. Rather than throw away a failed synthetic rubber, they turned it into something else - and the chemist that produced it kept on chemistry-ing. That was \"his thing\" - it was \"what he did\".\n\nAnyway, enough rambling. This is my first response to something I've read on Listserve, and I hope I didn't bungle it too badly or say nothing at all of help or substance. Feel free to ignore me, or write me back, or curse my name, or check out my games, or what have you. But... Do the things you want to do. Don't let fear of the future stop you, or slow you down. I'll be cheering for you the whole time.\n\nYours,",
