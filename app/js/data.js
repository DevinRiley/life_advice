(in english: The meaning of life is what remains after leaving out everything meaningless).<br><br>I like that quote a lot. There is no secret additive to create meaning. But there are a lot of things that definitely are not the meaning of life. Money? Gone when dead. Music? Not permanent. But the joy when playing music doesn't feel meaningless, therefore it's part of the meaning of life. Enjoying friendship, love, all these are not meaningless.<br><br>If you ask me, if that's all there is to life, that's not too shabby.<br><br>Then again, I believe crises are real, and no good advice will open up shortcuts.

It just made another \"why\" pop up.

I've always wanted to make an impact on the world and be immortal in a sense (through writing or some incredible deed that somehow \"saves the world.\") As you can imagine, I have been obsessed with superheroes since I was a kid. And when I was much much younger, I thought, \"hey, one day, my superpowers will come in, and then I can go out and right the wrongs of the world and make it a better place.\" Fast forward 15-20 years - no superpowers still. (Unless you count making and feeding an entire human being with only the power of my body. But hey, every second person on the world can do that. It doesn't seem so super then.) Ok so my solution (or what I'm trying to do now to help me not be depressed about how insignificant and tiny lives seem in comparison to the grand scheme of things) - write novels and help people. <br><br>Writing novels - haven't finished one yet, but I did start 4 or 5. I'm hoping that this November during NaNoWriMo, I will finish at least one. (NaNoWriMo - National Novel Writing Month) They may not be great novels, but maybe with practice, I can put something out there that someone will read and it will impact them and that person can go on to do bigger things that will impact more people. And the effect can snowball.<br><br>Helping people - I became an attorney. Currently, I do things in the immigration arena, but I have done crim defense and family law - helping people change habits to keep their kids or helping people avoid going into a system that will derail their lives that were up-till-that-point full-of-ok-choices. Mostly I just want to do pro bono stuff in all areas. I can what a huge impact it has on people's lives to have their legal issues taken care of. It's a matter of keeping families together or helping some hard-working individuals have access to more opportunities or something along those lines. <br><br>I don't think I'm in any position to give advice to anyone, but these things helped me, and hopefully it may help you as well!<br><br>Cheers,",
